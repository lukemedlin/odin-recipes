I will be creating a basic HTML website as an assignment to finish the HTML section of The Odin Project's foundational course

This website will demonstrate what I have learned so far.

I expect this to include using HTML tags like <!doctype html> and other boilerplate HTML code.

For the body, I will use h1 thru h6 tags for the headings and p tags for paragraphs.

I would also expect to include both absolute a href tags for external sites and relative (no https) for internal links to other pages on my site.

Images will also play a part.
